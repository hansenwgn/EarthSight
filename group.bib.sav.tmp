  abstract = {River floods and coastal storm surges affect the lives of more people than most other weather-related disasters. Floods can destroy homes, roads, and bridges; tear out trees; cause mudslides; and take many human lives. During flooding, timely and detailed situation reports are required by disaster management authorities to locate and identify affected areas and to implement damage mitigation. Remote sensing systems on satellites and aircraft can provide much of the required information for delineating the flood-affected areas, assessing the damage, and feeding models that can predict the vulnerability to flooding of inland and coastal areas. In this article, I provide an overview of remote sensing and modeling techniques for forecasting the vulnerability to flooding of an area, determining the extent and intensity of the flooding, and assessing the damage caused by the flood.},

  abstract = {Property-level flood risk adaptation (PLFRA) has received significant attention in recent years, as flood resilience has become increasingly important in flood risk management. Earlier studies have indicated that learning from flood experiences can affect flood risk perception and the adoption of PLFRA measures; however, it remains unclear whether and how this learning process can be affected by flood control infrastructure—specifically, the level of flood resistance it offers. This study attempts to answer the question: Do people living in environments with different levels of flood resistance learn different lessons from flood experience, manifested in flood risk perception and PLFRA? We present a comparative study of the rural village of Xinnongcun and the urban community of Nanhuyayuan in Central China. In-person interviews with a total of 34 local residents were conducted to understand how flood experiences affect flood risk perception and PLFRA. We find that learning from flood experiences in the highly flood-resistant environment (Nanhuyayuan) does not contribute to flood risk perception but further enhances flood resistance, whereas learning in a less flood-resistant environment (Xinnongcun) leads to a better understanding of flood risk and promotes PLFRA. We argue that flood resistance can affect the learning from flood experiences. High flood resistance can suppress PLFRA through a different learning process that involves learning inertia and path dependency. In the search for flood resilience, this begs society to re-examine the widespread assertion that both structural and nonstructural measures are important in flood risk management.},

The initiative, while following the U.S. low impact development with a concept also similar to the U.K. sustainable drainage systems and Australian water sensitive cities, is subject to a major design issue in practice with infrastructure projects of similar types adopted unanimously across regions despite spatially diverse and heterogeneous hydrological and biophysical conditions. The ecosystem services framework as applied to the urban setting, particularly its holistic consideration of ecosystem structure and management intervention in relation to services or benefits delivery, can and should guide the planning, design, development, and evaluation of relevant projects or nature-based practices for carrying out the policy initiative, a perspective of practical value with foreseeable transformative impact that has received little recognition in China's current green urban movement toward water resilience and sustainability.},

  abstract     = {Floods are a major cause of loss of lives, destruction of infrastructure, and massive damage to a country’s economy. Floods, being natural disasters, cannot be prevented completely; therefore, precautionary measures must be taken by the government, concerned organizations such as the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction and Office for the coordination of Human Affairs, and the community to control its disastrous effects. To minimize hazards and to provide an emergency response at the time of natural calamity, various measures must be taken by the disaster management authorities before the flood incident. This involves the use of the latest cutting-edge technologies which predict the occurrence of disaster as early as possible such that proper response strategies can be adopted before the disaster. Floods are uncertain depending on several climatic and environmental factors, and therefore are difficult to predict. Hence, improvement in the adoption of the latest technology to move towards automated disaster prediction and forecasting is a must. This study reviews the adoption of remote sensing methods for predicting floods and thus focuses on the pre-disaster phase of the disaster management process for the past 20 years. A classification framework is presented which classifies the remote sensing technologies being used for flood prediction into three types, which are: multispectral, radar, and light detection and ranging (LIDAR). Further categorization is performed based on the method used for data analysis. The technologies are examined based on their relevance to flood prediction, flood risk assessment, and hazard analysis. Some gaps and limitations present in each of the reviewed technologies have been identified. A flood prediction and extent mapping model are then proposed to overcome the current gaps. The compiled results demonstrate the state of each technology’s practice and usage in flood prediction.},

Remote sensingtechnology along with geographic information system (GIS)has become the key tool for flood monitoring in recent years.Development in this field has evolved from optical to radarremote sensing, which has provided all weather capabilitycompared to the optical sensors for the purpose of flood mapping.The central focus in this field revolves around delineation of floodzones and preparation of flood hazard maps for the vulnerable areas.In this exercise flood depth is considered crucial for flood hazardmapping and a digital elevation model (DEM) is considered to bethe most effective means to estimate flood depth from remotelysensed or hydrological data. In a flat terrain accuracy of floodestimation depends primarily on the resolution of the DEM. Riverflooding in the developing countries of monsoon Asia is very acutebecause of their heavy dependence on agriculture but any floodestimation or hazard mapping attempt in this region is handicappedby poor availability of high resolution DEMs. This paper presents areview of application of remote sensing and GIS in flood managementwith particular focus on the developing countries of Asia.},

  abstract     = {Wetlands are often acknowledged as a nature-based solution for improving flood resilience in a large river basin. However, the effects of wetlands on floods have not been assessed as extensively within a large river basin, as previous studies have mainly focused on assessing the effect on peak flows of a certain given return period. In this study, a distributed hydrological modeling platform was used to (i) quantify the effect of wetlands on floods with respect to event hydrographs, and (ii) investigate how flood regulation services can occur on the rising and falling limbs of an event hydrograph. Further, we hypothesized that flood resilience depends on the distribution and location of wetlands in the basin. The hydrological modeling study was conducted on a 297,000-km2 large river basin in Northeast China, where wetlands are abundant covering approximately 12\% of the basin area. Our modeling study show that wetlands can reduce peak and mean flows, event duration, and flow volume (i.e., runoff volume) by, respectively, 24\% (12.14~mm), 12\% (4.37~mm), 4\% (1~day), and 17\% (18~×~108·m3) in this large river basin. The attenuation efficiency of these wetlands varied with their location and size in the basin, especially apparent on peak flow, mean flow and flow volume on the rising limb of a flood event. These findings highlight flood regulation services and attest that wetlands can exhibit different effects; that sometimes they may amplify flood conditions. Thus, wetlands are an important land cover for enhancing resilience to flood events within large river basins, and wetla

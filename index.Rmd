# Context, Existing Regulations, & Problem Definition
---
# Malaysia's Disaster Risk Profile

- Malaysia had the highest percentage (67%) of the population exposed to floods among ASEAN Member States (between July 2012 and January 2019) as reported by ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management in March 2019.

- Monsoon and flash floods are the primary climate related natural disasters in the country.

- Nine percent of land area in Malaysia is flood prone and 4.8 million people live in areas at risk to flood.

- Worst floods in the past 30 years have occurred from 2003 onwards. The majority of natural disasters from 1998 to 2018 were natural disasters (38/51).

- Over the past 3 years, Malaysia has suffered from the heaviest floods in its history in over 2 decades, affecting states all across the nation.
---

#Flood Impacts

###Social 
- Tens of thousands suffer from population displacement annually. Lives have also been lost.

###Economic
- Damages and losses across different sectors (public infrastructure, housing, business premises, private vehicles, agriculture,) amounting to £113 million / USD138.8 million / RM622.4 million in 2022 alone.

- Certain states suffer from heavier losses than others, impacting economic output and weakening their ability to recover. 

###Environmental
- Exacerbates soil erosion, leading to an increase in landslides (another natural disaster Malaysia is prone to).
---
# Location Selection: Why Kuala Lumpur?
- Malaysia's capital city.

- Serves as the economic centre of Malaysia alongside the neighbouring state of Selangor (known as the Klang Valley). Damage to the federal territory and its surroundings impedes the country's economic output as most businesses are closest to the country's capital.

- KL is the most complete infrastructure-wise, will act as a benchmark for other states in terms of development goals.

We intend to introduce the proposed model across the rest of the Malaysian states if this preliminary project is deemed successful.
---
# Research Questions
- What is the current structure and practices in place to respond to natural disasters?

- What gaps can we identify within the aforementioned system?

- What current remote sensing methods are being used to acquire topographic information in Malaysia?

```
---
# Gaps Identified Within Framework/Problem Definition

- Insufficient data
  - Data is only sufficient enough for forecasting flood occurrence, not for the prediction of potential flood prone areas.

- Disjointed coordination between relevant stakeholders
  - Framework is reactive instead of proactive, relevant authorities mobilise resources only after disaster has taken place.
  
- Incomplete stakeholder involvement
   - Only disaster-related agencies are a part of the framework. Involvement should include all ministries affected by ramifications of natural disasters.
  
---
# Aims of Proposal
- To provide a more comprehensive disaster response mechanism using current remotely sensed methods.

- To ensure alignment of data-driven methods for disaster risk mitigation in line with goals set by ratified international agreements (COP26, SDG goals, C40 cities, Sendai Framework).

- To identify gaps for integration of proposed methods to existing disaster risk framework.

- To expand accessibility of findings beyond disaster response to incorporate involvement of all relevant departments and ministries.

--- 
## Workflow and Methodology
- To make policies implementable

  - Need to propose real analysis workflow
  
  - Give prototypes illustrating how EO data and remote sensing can help
  
  - Fit the workflow into the flood solution
  
  - Work on the chaining of function modules and potential automisation of pipeline
  
- How can these facilitate minimising risks for people, governments and more

  - How are information gaps closed
  
  - How are losses prevented
  
  - Identify persisting risks

## Flood Forecasting - A Quick Review
### The old-fashioned way - Hydrological model 
Uses historical data on precipitation, runoff, and other factors to predict flood occurrences. 
Relies on physical equations and mathematical representations of the water cycle, e.g.:
- Continuity Equation Balances water storage (∆S) with inflow (I) and outflow (O): 
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta S = I - O
    \end{equation}
- Runoff Estimation: 
$$Q = (P - Ia)^2 / (P - Ia + S)$$
  Where
  - Q: direct runoff (depth)
  - P: direct runoff (depth) 
  - Ia: initial abstraction, representing the water intercepted by vegetation, infiltration, and surface storage
  - S: potential maximum retention (depth), depending on soil type, land use, antecedent moisture conditions

### The old-fashioned way - Hydrological model 

Example of simulating watershed on a map of Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
- Continuity Equation 
  - Ensures the water balance
  - Tracks the flow of water (through e.g. surface water, soil moisture and groundwater)

### Machine-learning based prediction - A blackbox considering numerous factors

| Data Pipeline Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data Collection | Collect geo-environmental data for Kuala Lumpur, including elevation, slope, soil type, substrate, land cover, NDVI, land use, imperviousness, distance to river, and distance to road |
| Preprocessing | Standardize maps using QGIS: project into EPSG:3168 coordinate system, convert vector to raster maps, clip to Kuala Lumpur boundaries, resample to 1m resolution, and convert raster images to numerical data with 10m grid size using Rasterio |
| Feature Selection | Perform multicollinearity diagnosis test to exclude similar features, reducing training time and computational power. Use features with VIF less than 10 in ANN models |
| Data Balancing | Balance data with oversampling and undersampling due to imbalanced flood risk distribution. Adjust non-flood areas (98%, 95%, 90% for 30-, 100-, and 1000-year events) and level 4 risk areas (0.01% and 0.06% for 30- and 100-year events) |
| Model Selection & Assessment | Apply NB, perceptron, ANN, and CNN models for 30-, 100-, and 1000-year flood events. Evaluate performance using suitable metrics |

## Assessing flood damage
### Overview
Considering that Malaysia does not have enough datasets for analyzing, in this case, we need to make sure that the datasets that we owned can satisfy the methodology we select.  

Under this circumstance, we decide to use night light and census data to evaluate the number of people affected. The process is divided into three major steps: data pre-processing, model building and assessment.

* First, the NPP-VIIRS night-light remote sensing data were resampled to 500m × 500m based on the administrative map with image cropping, Albers projection and nearest neighbor interpolation, and the negative areas were assigned a value of 0. 

* Using the statistical volume method of radiation normalization to reducing the impact of cloud cover on night-light remote sensing imagery(Zhao et al. 2020).

## Assessing flood damage
### Building model

Light index can indicate the dynamics population and economic development. To be specific, light density can represent the density of population, light area can represent the distribution of population, the tendency of urban expansion(He et al. 2022).

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Building model
$$LD=(1/N)\sum_{i = 1}^{i=n}D N_{i}$$ 
$$LA=\sum{i}, D N_{i}>1 $$ 

In the formula, $LD$ is the average of light density, $LA$ is the area of light and $DN_{i}$ is the brightness of pixel.

$$y=a\times R_{VIIRS} + b$$ 
$$y=a\times R_{VIIRS}^{2} + b\times R_{VIIRS} + c$$ 

$y$ is population related parameters, $R_{VIIRS}$ is NPP-VIIRS night light brightness radiation value, a, b, c are constant items.

$$P_{E}=\rho_{e} \times A_{e}$$ 

$P_{E}$ is the total affected population; $\rho_{e}$ is the population density of the affected area; $A_{e}$ is the affected area.

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Assessing model
Before and after the flood, the brightness of the lights changed significantly, and the damage of power lines, the collapse of buildings and evacuation of people caused the brightness of the lights to decrease significantly.

In that case, by comparing the images of light between before disaster and after disaster we can get the information of the disappear of light. Based on above formula and information, we can estimate how many people suffer the disaster and economic losses as well.

#But how do we evaluate the accuracy of our model?#

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Assessing model

Before we apply we model, we can estimate the number of people firstly by using the before disaster's image and access the accuracy of our model.

$$RE=\frac{R_{e}-R_{s}}{R_{s}}\times100\%$$ 

$R_{e}$ is the population of estimate, and $R_{s}$ is the ture value of population.

## Project Management - Value for Money
The total budget for this project is £500,000 / USD613,515 / RM2.8 million. We will streamline the project to save money. To reduce costs, we will prioritise open-source software and free data sources. We will also create flood risk maps and mitigation strategies that the Malaysian government can use in its daily operations. This project will help Malaysian flood risk management, making it a good city investment.

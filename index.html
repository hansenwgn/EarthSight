# Context and Regulation
---
# Malaysia's Disaster Risk Profile

- Malaysia had the highest percentage (67%) of the population exposed to floods among ASEAN Member States (between July 2012 and January 2019) as reported by ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management in March 2019.

- Monsoon and flash floods are the primary climate related natural disasters in the country.

- Nine percent of land area in Malaysia is flood prone and 4.8 million people live in areas at risk to flood.

- Worst floods in the past 30 years have occurred from 2003 onwards. The majority of natural disasters from 1998 to 2018 were natural disasters (38/51).

- Over the past 3 years, Malaysia has suffered from the heaviest floods in its history in over 2 decades, affecting states all across the nation.
---

#Flood Impacts

###Social 
- Tens of thousands suffer from population displacement annually. Lives have also been lost.

###Economic
- 

###Environmental
- 
---
# Location Selection: Why Kuala Lumpur?
- Malaysia's capital city.

- Serves as the economic centre of Malaysia alongside the neighbouring state of Selangor. Damage to the federal territory and its surroundings impedes the country's economic output as most businesses are closest to the country's capital.

- KL is the most complete infrastructure-wise, will act as a benchmark for other states in terms of development goals.
---
# Research Questions
- What is the current structure and practices in place to respond to natural disasters?

- what gaps can we identify within the aforementioned system?

- What current remote sensing methods are being used to acquire topographic information in Malaysia?

---
# Malaysia's Disaster Risk Reduction Framework

---
# Gaps Identified Within Current Framework

- Insufficient data available
  - Data is only sufficient enough for forecasting flood occurrence, not for the prediction of potential flood prone areas or the.

- Disjointed coordination between relevant stakeholders: 
  - Framework is reactive instead of proactive, relevant authorities mobilise resources only after disaster has taken place.
  
  - Only disaster-related agencies are a part of the framework. Involvement should include all ministries affected by ramifications of natural disasters.
  
--- 
# Aims of Proposal
- To provide a more comprehensive disaster response mechanism using current remotely sensed methods.

- To ensure alignment of data-driven methods for disaster risk mitigation in line with goals set by ratified international agreements (COP26, SDG goals, C40 cities, Sendai Framework).

- To identify gaps for integration of proposed methods to existing disaster risk framework.

- To expand accessibility of findings beyond disaster response to incorporate involvement of all relevant departments and ministries. 

---

--- 
## Workflow and Methodology (Tongmeng and Zirui)
- To make policies implementable

  - Need to propose real analysis workflow
  
  - Give prototypes illustrating how EO data and remote sensing can help
  
  - Fit the workflow into the flood solution
  
  - Work on the chaining of function modules and potential automisation of pipeline
  
- How can these facilitate minimising risks for people, governments and more

  - How are information gaps closed
  
  - How are loss prevented
  
  - Identify persisting risks

## Flood Forecasting - A Quick Review
### The old-fashioned way - Hydrological model 
Uses historical data on precipitation, runoff, and other factors to predict flood occurrences. 
Relies on physical equations and mathematical representations of the water cycle, e.g.:
- Continuity Equation Balances water storage (∆S) with inflow (I) and outflow (O): 
  \begin{equation}
    \Delta S = I - O
    \end{equation}
- Runoff Estimation: 
`$$Q = (P - Ia)^2 / (P - Ia + S)$$`
  Where
  - Q: direct runoff (depth)
  - P: direct runoff (depth) 
  - Ia: initial abstraction, representing the water intercepted by vegetation, infiltration, and surface storage
  - S: potential maximum retention (depth), depending on soil type, land use, antecedent moisture conditions
  
---
### The old-fashioned way - Hydrological model 

Example of simulating watershed on a map of Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
- Continuity Equation 
  - Ensures the water balance
  - Tracks the flow of water (through e.g. surface water, soil moisture and groundwater)
- Runoff Estimation: 
  - quantifying the amount of water

### The old-fashioned way - Hydrological model 
DEM-based hydrological models 
- Identify low-lying areas and floodplains in the urban landscape that are more susceptible to flooding. 
- Inform decisions
  - Planners: Floodplain zoning and land-use planning 
  - Emergency response teams can prioritise levees and floodwalls construction in certain areas
  - Design evacuation plans to minimise casualties

## Flood risk management —— Flood prediction
### Machine Learning based multifactor-considering blackbox
| Data Pipeline Step | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Data Collection | Obtain geo-environmental data of Exeter, including elevation, slope, soil type, substrate, land cover, NDVI, land use, imperviousness, distance to river, and distance to road |
| Preprocessing | Use QGIS to project all maps into an EPSG:27700 projected coordinate system for the United Kingdom, convert vector maps into raster maps, extract the clip of maps by mask layer based on the boundary of Exeter from an administrative division map of England, resample and set the resolution as 1 m, and convert data to numerical data from raster images with a grid size of 10 m using Rasterio tool |
| Feature Selection | Use multicollinearity diagnosis test to prevent inputting similar features into the models and save training time and computation power. All features with VIF less than 10 are applied to train NB, perceptron, ANN, and CNN models |
| Data Balancing | Use oversampling and undersampling methods to balance the data, as the distribution of flood risks is extremely imbalanced. Non-flood areas account for about 98%, 95%, and 90% for 30-year, 100-year, and 1000-year flood events. Level 4 risk areas only account for 0.01% and 0.06% for 30-year and 100-year flood events, respectively |
| Model Selection and Assessment | Apply NB, perceptron, ANN, and CNN models to assess the flood risk of 30-year, 100-year, and 1000-year flood events. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics |

## Flood risk management - Real Time monitoring

## Assessing flood damage
### Overview
Considering that Malaysia does not have enough datasets for analyzing, in this case, we need to make sure that the datasets that we owned can satisfy the methodology we select.  

Under this circumstance, we decide to use night light and census data to evaluate the number of people affected. The process is divided into three major steps: data pre-processing, model building and assessment.

## Assessing flood damage
### Work flow
&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="night/flow.png" alt="flow chart" width="90%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;flow chart&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Data pre-process



* First, the NPP-VIIRS night-light remote sensing data were resampled to 500m × 500m based on the administrative map with image cropping, Albers projection and nearest neighbor interpolation, and the negative areas were assigned a value of 0. 

* Using the statistical volume method of radiation normalization to reducing the impact of cloud cover on night-light remote sensing imagery .

## Assessing flood damage
### Building model

Light index can indicate the dynamics population and economic development. To be specific, light density can represent the density of population, light area can represent the distribution of population, the tendency of urban expansion .

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Building model
`$$LD=(1/N)\sum_{i = 1}^{i=n}D N_{i}$$` 
$$LA=\sum{i}, D N_{i}&gt;1 $$ 

In the formula, `\(LD\)` is the average of light density, `\(LA\)` is the area of light and `\(DN_{i}\)` is the brightness of pixel.

`$$y=a\times R_{VIIRS} + b$$` 
`$$y=a\times R_{VIIRS}^{2} + b\times R_{VIIRS} + c$$` 

`\(y\)` is population related parameters, `\(R_{VIIRS}\)` is NPP-VIIRS night light brightness radiation value, a, b, c are constant items.

`$$P_{E}=\rho_{e} \times A_{e}$$` 

`\(P_{E}\)` is the total affected population; `\(rho_{e}\)` is the population density of the affected area; `\(A_{e}\)` is the affected area.

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Assess model
Before and after the flood, the brightness of the lights changed significantly, and the damage of power lines, the collapse of buildings and evacuation of people caused the brightness of the lights to decrease significantly.

In that case, by comparing the images of light between before disaster and after disaster we can get the information of the disappear of light. Based on above formula and information, we can estimate how many people suffer the disaster and economic losses as well.

#But how do we evaluate the accuracy of our model?#

---
## Assessing flood damage
### Assess model

Before we apply we model, we can estimate the number of people firstly by using the before disaster's image and access the accuracy of our model.

`$$RE=\frac{R_{e}-R_{s}}{R_{s}}\times100\%$$` 

`\(R_{e}\)` is the population of estimate, and `\(R_{s}\)` is the ture value of population.

| Relative margin of error | Level of accuracy  |
| --- | --- |
|&gt; 50%| High   |
| 25% ~ 50% | Medium |
|&lt; 25% | Low    |
